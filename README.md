# GherkinScriptsAutoGeneration
Deployment Guide

### Description

## Prerequisites
1. Java 1.8
2. Maven


## Local Deployment
```
1.  Clone the Project: git clone https://github.com/mrshimi17/GherkinScriptsAutoGeneration.git
2.  Execute command: java -cp AutoGeneratedGherkinScripts-jar-with-dependencies.jar runner.PDFParser
3.  Provide path to the PDF files. I have committed the files under src/test/resources folder. So the pdf file path would be src/test/resources
4.  You can see the .feature files are generated under src/test/java/features and a step definition file generated under src/test/java/definitions package.
5.  Remove Below step definitions from stepdefinitions.java file. (This is manual for now)

@Given("^the user clicks \"([^\"]*)\"$")
public void the_user_clicks(String arg1) throws Throwable {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
}



@Then("^the user clicks \"([^\"]*)\"$")
public void the_user_clicks(String arg1) throws Throwable {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
}
```

## Production Build and Installation
