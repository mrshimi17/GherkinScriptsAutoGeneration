# GherkinScriptsAutoGeneration
Deployment Guide

### Description

## Prerequisites
1.  Java 1.8
2.  Maven


## Local Deployment
```
1.  Execute command: java -cp AutoGeneratedGherkinScripts-jar-with-dependencies.jar runner.PDFParser

2.  Provide path to the PDF files. I have committed the files under src/test/resources folder. So the pdf file path would be src/test/resources
3.  You can see the .feature files are generated under src/test/java/features and a step definition file generated under src/test/java/definitions package.
4.  Remove Below step definitions from stepdefinitions.java file. (This is manual for now)

@Given("^the user clicks \"([^\"]*)\"$")
public void the_user_clicks(String arg1) throws Throwable {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
}



@Then("^the user clicks \"([^\"]*)\"$")
public void the_user_clicks(String arg1) throws Throwable {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
}
5.  Verify the .feature files and stepdefinition.java file by opening them in eclipse.
```
